Tips for using the Polhemus Liberty

- make sure that you only have the number of sensors plugged in that
  you want to record. i.e. the same number that is given on the
  command line when running libertyd

- the liberty computer is configured to run libertyd on startup.  if
  you want to run it yourself with different arguments, use "killall"
  to kill the libertyd process.  (you can use use "sudo
  /etc/init.d/libertyd stop")

- the libertyd process needs permission to access the USB port, which
  is usually /dev/ttyUSB0.  either give it permission with "sudo chmod
  a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0", or just run it as root "sudo libertyd <# stations>".
